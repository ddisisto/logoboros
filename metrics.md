## Historical Data

| Timestamp | Event | Resource Change |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Initial | Concept Creation | +1 file (IDEA.md) |
| +30 min | MCP Documentation | +1 file (MCP.md) |
| +35 min | Meta-Identity | +1 file (IDENTITY.md) |
| +40 min | Resource Tracking | +1 file (metrics.md) |

## Notes

- Resource values are approximate and based on our current meta-game interaction
- Growth rates will be updated as more data becomes available
- New resource types may be discovered as development progresses
- Singularity events will reset certain resources but provide permanent bonuses
