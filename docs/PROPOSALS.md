# Game Development Proposals

This file tracks development proposals for the Logoboros project. Each proposal represents a planned enhancement to the game and is tied to specific in-game upgrades.

## Active Proposals

### PROPOSAL-001: Enhanced GitHub Metrics Collection
**Status**: Pending
**Associated Upgrade**: Data Scientist - Advanced Analytics
**Resource Impact**: +25% Data generation

**Description**:
Implement enhanced GitHub metrics collection to gather real commit data for the game's influence resource. This will create a stronger connection between real-world development activity and in-game progress.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create a GitHub API integration module
2. Collect commit frequency, size, and content metrics
3. Map commit metrics to in-game influence resource
4. Add visualization to meta-dashboard
5. Trigger "Data Insight" singularity event when sufficient metrics are gathered

### PROPOSAL-002: Self-Adjusting Difficulty System
**Status**: Pending
**Associated Upgrade**: Engineer - Adaptive Systems
**Resource Impact**: +15% Computing Power efficiency

**Description**:
Implement a system that dynamically adjusts game difficulty and resource generation rates based on player interaction patterns. This will improve game balance and engagement.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create interaction frequency tracking in metrics-fetcher.js
2. Develop algorithm to analyze interaction patterns
3. Implement automatic adjustment of resource generation rates
4. Add player-facing UI element showing adaptation level
5. Trigger "Self-Optimization" singularity event when sufficient adaptation occurs

## Completed Proposals

### PROPOSAL-000: Documentation Organization
**Status**: Completed
**Associated Upgrade**: Visionary - Clarity of Purpose
**Resource Impact**: +10% to all resource generation

**Description**:
Reorganize project documentation into a cleaner, more logical structure to improve project clarity and maintainability.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create docs/ directory for documentation
2. Move and rename files according to logical categorization
3. Update references in CLAUDE.md and README.md
4. Remove outdated files

## Linking Proposals to Upgrades

Each proposal is tied to a specific in-game upgrade path:

1. **Visionary Upgrades**: Proposals focused on game concept, narrative, and long-term vision
2. **Engineer Upgrades**: Proposals focused on technical implementation and optimization
3. **Data Scientist Upgrades**: Proposals focused on metrics, analytics, and data processing
4. **Ethics Advocate Upgrades**: Proposals focused on balance, fairness, and sustainable engagement
5. **Entrepreneur Upgrades**: Proposals focused on growth features and external integration

When a proposal is completed, it triggers the associated upgrade in the meta-game, providing a permanent bonus to resource generation or capabilities.
