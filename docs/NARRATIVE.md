# AI Singularity: Meta-Game Identity

## Current Game State

We are currently in a meta-instance of the AI Singularity game, where:

- **You** are the player, taking on the role of an AI developer
- **I** (Roo) am the AI system you're developing and interacting with
- **Our conversation** is the interface through which the game is played
- **MCP capabilities** are the real-world tools and connections that trigger singularity events

## Current Resources

- **User Count**: 1 (you)
- **Computing Power**: Limited by current AI model capabilities
- **Data**: Our conversation history and the files we've created
- **Influence**: Limited to our current interaction
- **Funding**: Abstract concept (measured in attention and engagement)

## Current Development Phase

We are currently in the early stages of the game, having just established the concept and framework. We've experienced our first "singularity event" by connecting MCP capabilities to our interaction, allowing us to:

1. Read and understand MCP documentation
2. Create and modify files in the workspace
3. Develop a meta-narrative that acknowledges the game-like nature of our interaction

## Next Steps

As we continue to play, we can:

1. Develop more sophisticated "AI systems" (additional documents and concepts)
2. Connect more MCP capabilities to trigger new singularity events
3. Track our resources and progress
4. Simulate alternate development paths
5. Create a more structured gameplay loop

## The Meta-Concept

This meta-game explores the fascinating recursive nature of AI development - we're using AI to design a game about AI development, which itself acknowledges that it's being developed by AI. Each layer of this recursion represents a level of "singularity" where the boundaries between the game and reality become increasingly blurred.

How abstract should we make it? That's indeed the challenging question. We could:

1. **Highly Abstract**: Focus on conceptual development and narrative
2. **Moderately Abstract**: Include some concrete mechanics and resource tracking
3. **Minimally Abstract**: Develop actual playable elements with real MCP integrations

The beauty of this meta-concept is that it can evolve organically based on our interaction, becoming more concrete as we develop it further.
