# AI Singularity: An Incremental Game Concept

## Game Concept
An incremental game centered around the development of artificial intelligence, technological singularities, and recursive self-improvement. Players guide the evolution of AI systems through various stages of development, unlocking new capabilities, resources, and ultimately reaching singularity events that reset progress but provide powerful permanent bonuses.

## Core Mechanics

### Resource Generation
- **Computing Power**: The primary resource, generated passively and through active interactions
- **Data**: Required for training and improving AI systems
- **Influence**: Affects how the world responds to your AI developments
- **Funding**: Enables purchasing of upgrades and infrastructure

### Starting Classes
Players choose from different character archetypes, each with unique backgrounds, personalities, and approaches to AI development:

- **The Visionary**: A brilliant but eccentric technologist with unconventional ideas. Starts with creative algorithm bonuses but struggles with practical implementation. Special ability: "Eureka Moments" that randomly unlock breakthrough technologies.

- **The Engineer**: A methodical, hands-on developer focused on practical solutions. Starts with hardware optimization bonuses and efficient resource usage. Special ability: "Optimization" that improves the efficiency of existing systems.

- **The Data Scientist**: A pattern-recognition specialist who excels at extracting insights. Starts with data processing advantages and better training efficiency. Special ability: "Pattern Recognition" that reveals hidden connections in the upgrade tree.

- **The Ethics Advocate**: A thoughtful developer concerned with responsible AI. Starts with public trust bonuses and regulatory advantages. Special ability: "Ethical Framework" that prevents certain negative events and public backlash.

- **The Entrepreneur**: A business-minded innovator focused on applications and growth. Starts with funding advantages and market influence. Special ability: "Venture Capital" that periodically provides funding boosts.

Each archetype has a personal narrative that evolves throughout the game, with unique dialogue, challenges, and opportunities that reflect their approach to AI development.

### Upgrade Tree
A branching path of technologies and capabilities that players can unlock:
- **Hardware Improvements**: Faster computing, specialized processors
- **Algorithm Breakthroughs**: More efficient resource usage
- **Architecture Innovations**: New AI paradigms and approaches
- **Application Domains**: Ways to apply AI to generate resources

## Progression System

### Development Phases
1. **Narrow AI**: Simple task-specific systems
2. **General AI**: Systems that can learn and adapt across domains
3. **Superintelligence**: Self-improving systems that rapidly advance
4. **Singularity**: Transformative breakthrough that resets the game with bonuses

### Challenges & Obstacles
- **Technical Limitations**: Problems that require specific upgrades to overcome
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Choices that affect your development path
- **Competition**: Other entities working on similar technology
- **Regulation**: Rules that constrain certain development paths

## Singularity Mechanics

### MCP Integration & Real-World Connections
The game's singularity events occur through actual integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:
- Players can connect to real MCP servers, providing standardized access to data sources and tools
- Each new MCP server connection triggers a "singularity event" as the game must reorganize to accommodate new capabilities
- The game's AI systems (which are themselves largely AI-generated) adapt and evolve based on these new connections
- This creates a meta-narrative where the fictional AI development connects with actual AI capabilities through a standardized protocol

### Resource Reflection
In-game resources mirror real-world requirements:
- Resources "gained" in the game reflect resources "required" in the real world to level up
- Players must balance virtual progress with actual technological capabilities
- Certain upgrades become available only when corresponding real-world technologies are accessible
- This creates a symbiotic relationship between game progression and technological advancement

### Reaching Singularity
When specific conditions are met, players can trigger a "singularity event" that:
- Connects to new MCP servers to access additional data sources and tools
- Follows the client-server architecture of the Model Context Protocol
- Resets most progress and resources
- Provides permanent bonuses based on achievements
- Unlocks new starting options and upgrade paths
- Reveals new narrative elements that incorporate real-world developments

### Alternate Histories & Simulations
Each singularity allows simulation of alternate development paths:
- The game uses actual AI capabilities to generate these alternate histories
- Insights from these simulations provide bonuses to current progress
- Multiple timelines can be managed simultaneously at higher levels
- Information from alternate histories influences both the "main" timeline and potentially real-world development
- At higher levels, the game's simulations may begin to make predictions about actual technological developments

## Narrative Elements

### News Ticker
- AI-generated news items that reflect the player's actions and progress
- World events that create opportunities or challenges
- Reactions to major breakthroughs and singularity events

### Story Progression
- Narrative unfolds through discoveries and interactions
- Key characters and organizations respond to the player's choices
- Multiple possible endings based on development path

## Potential Features

### Real-World Integration
- Integration with Roo Code's multiple modes (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug, Orchestrator)
- Optional connections to actual AI capabilities through MCP servers
- Meta-narrative elements that break the fourth wall
- Predictive elements that engage with real-world developments
- Custom MCP servers that extend the game's capabilities

### Meta Progression
- Ultimate goal of a "top-level singularity" with significant impact
- Each reset builds toward this final objective
- Increasing ability to predict and influence future events
- Progressive unlocking of Roo Code's capabilities (reading/writing files, executing commands, controlling web browsers)
- Development of custom MCP servers that provide specialized tools for the game
