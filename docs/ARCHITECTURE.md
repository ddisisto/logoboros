# AI Singularity Game - Refactoring Roadmap

## Current Architecture Issues

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas that would benefit from refactoring:

### 1. Code Organization
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all combined** in index.html, making it difficult to maintain
- **Game logic is monolithic** with all functionality in a single script block
- **No modular structure** for separating concerns

### 2. Architectural Concerns
- **No clear separation** between game state, UI rendering, and business logic
- **Direct DOM manipulation** scattered throughout the code
- **Event handling is fragmented** across different functions
- **Tight coupling** between game components and MCP functionality

### 3. MCP Implementation
- **Overlapping responsibilities** between bridge.js and mcp-server.js
- **Debug code mixed with production code**
- **Complex event-based communication** that could lead to race conditions

## Recommended Refactoring Approach

I recommend a comprehensive refactoring that follows modern web development practices:

### 1. Separate Concerns
- Extract CSS into dedicated stylesheets
- Move JavaScript into modular files
- Implement a proper component structure

### 2. Implement Modern Architecture
- Create a state management system
- Develop a UI component system
- Establish a clear event handling mechanism
- Implement proper abstraction layers

### 3. Improve MCP Integration
- Refine the MCP interface
- Separate real vs. simulated functionality
- Create a cleaner bridge implementation

```

## Implementation Strategy

I recommend implementing this refactoring in phases:

### Phase 1: Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Extract CSS into external stylesheets
- Move JavaScript into separate files
- Maintain current functionality

### Phase 2: Implement Core Architecture
- Create state management system
- Develop event bus for communication
- Refactor MCP interface

### Phase 3: Modularize Game Components
- Create component-based structure
- Implement proper rendering lifecycle
- Improve event handling

### Phase 4: Enhance and Optimize
- Add proper error handling
- Implement logging system
- Separate development and production code

This refactoring will significantly improve code maintainability, make future feature additions easier, and provide a more robust foundation for the game.
