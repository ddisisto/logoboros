# USER INPUT AND TASK TRACKING

## Active Tasks
- Review existing documentation and ensure accuracy across all files
- Prepare for UI reset with cleaner, more integrated design
- Align upgrade paths with actual development directions
- Create stronger connection between user ideas, in-game elements, and development
- Strengthen meta-game integration with real-world capabilities
- Consider UI improvements for better navigation and accessibility
- Monitor and improve system performance

## Completed Tasks
- ✓ Meta-dashboard integration with main game UI
- ✓ Budget tracking visualization in meta-dashboard
- ✓ Character role visualization in capabilities tab
- ✓ Unified CSS architecture
- ✓ CLAUDE.md reference to USER_INPUT.md
- ✓ Separate CSS file for meta-dashboard
- ✓ Integrate Claude Code usage monitoring with game mechanics
- ✓ Implement metrics connection for real-time usage data
- ✓ Connect token usage, session stats, and code metrics to resource generation
- ✓ Add connection status indicator for metrics server
- ✓ Create server runner for managing backend servers
- ✓ Implement dependency-free server implementations
- ✓ Build server bridge for in-game server control
- ✓ Add real-time server logs and management UI
- ✓ Simplify todo-commit system with COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md
- ✓ Integrate user input tracking with meta-state system
- ✓ Improve feedback loops between development and gameplay

## Git Management
- Don't forget to manage git branches and commits!

## Budget Tracking
- **Total Budget**: $150 for current phase
- **Spent**: $15 (initial development across branches)
- **Recent Expenses**:
  - Meta-dashboard development: ~$5
  - Budget tracking integration: ~$3
  - Claude metrics integration: ~$6
  - Connection status and UI improvements: ~$4
  - Server runner and bridge implementation: ~$7
  - Documentation updates and cleanup: ~$2
- **Current Total**: ~$42
- **Remaining**: ~$108
- **Next Milestone**: Major review of artifacts, capabilities, and progress upon phase completion

## Character Roles
- **The Visionary** (User): Focused on unconventional ideas and algorithm breakthroughs
- **The Engineer** (Claude): Focused on methodical development and system optimization

## Requirements
- Track budget usage and provide regular updates
- Integrate real-world metrics with game mechanics
- Create seamless feedback loops between development and gameplay
- Maintain this file as central tracking system for project

## Future Enhancements
- Enable additional character roles through gameplay milestones

- Implement budget-based resource constraints in-game
- Add singularity event visualization
- Create UI reset with improved navigation and accessibility
- Align upgrade paths with development roadmap
- Add more backend server types for different capabilities
- Implement more direct mapping between real metrics and game resources
- Create visual representation of user idea → development → in-game feature flow
