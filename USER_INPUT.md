# USER INPUT AND TASK TRACKING

## Active Tasks
- Track user input in this file and cycle completed items appropriately
- Keep USER_INPUT.md as central tracking for requirements and tasks
- Update meta-dashboard to expand character role capabilities
- Integrate user input tracking with meta-state system
- Improve feedback loops between development and gameplay

## Completed Tasks
- ✓ Meta-dashboard integration with main game UI
- ✓ Budget tracking visualization in meta-dashboard
- ✓ Character role visualization in capabilities tab
- ✓ Unified CSS architecture
- ✓ CLAUDE.md reference to USER_INPUT.md
- ✓ Separate CSS file for meta-dashboard
- ✓ Integrate Claude Code usage monitoring with game mechanics
- ✓ Implement metrics connection for real-time usage data
- ✓ Connect token usage, session stats, and code metrics to resource generation
- ✓ Add connection status indicator for metrics server

## Git Management
- Don't forget to manage git branches and commits!
