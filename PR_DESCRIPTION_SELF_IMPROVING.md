# Self-Improving System Implementation

This PR implements a comprehensive self-improving system for the game, creating feedback loops between development and gameplay, and enhancing the meta-game concept with real-world metrics.

## Summary

- **Documentation Reorganization**: Created a cleaner structure with a dedicated `docs/` directory
- **Proposal System**: Added a system for tracking development proposals tied to in-game upgrades
- **GitHub Metrics Integration**: Real commit data now influences the game's "influence" resource
- **Todo-Commit System**: Completed tasks generate commit suggestions, creating a planning-implementation loop
- **Enhanced Components Initialization**: Updated main.js to initialize all self-improving components

## Components

### 1. Documentation Structure
- Moved all documentation to `docs/` directory
- Renamed files for clarity and consistency
- Added `PROPOSALS.md` for tracking development initiatives

### 2. GitHub Metrics System
- Created `github-metrics.js` with GitHub API integration
- Calculates repository activity score and influence level
- Maps repository metrics to in-game resources
- Triggers singularity events based on development patterns

### 3. Todo-Commit Integration
- Implemented `todo-commit-system.js` to track tasks and commits
- Creates correlations between completed todos and commits
- Generates commit message suggestions from completed tasks
- Updates meta-state based on development progress
- Triggers "Systematic Development" singularity event

### 4. Self-Improving Mechanisms
- Enhanced recursive feedback loops in the meta-game
- Direct mapping between development activities and game resources
- Singularity events triggered by development milestones
- Character classes tied to development proposal types

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Check browser console for component initialization 
3. Verify meta-dashboard displays updated metrics
4. Complete todos and observe commit suggestions
5. Make commits to trigger influence changes

## Future Enhancements

- Further integration with GitHub API for more detailed metrics
- Enhanced visualization of development patterns in meta-dashboard
- More sophisticated correlation analysis between tasks and code
- Additional singularity events based on development milestones
